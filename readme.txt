What is it?
This is an updated version of Feral.cs that comes with Singular.
I just improved the combat rotations for cat and bear.

All credits go to the creators of Singular.

Who can use this shit?
You should be able to use it with every Botbase available.
It should work with every level - in dungeons, in raids, while questing, farming and pvp.

Why should i download it?
The implemented rotations that came with Singular are not that good. This CC will use the best rotations possible. It is updated for Patch 4.3..
Its rotations are designed for PVE - they will do tons of dmg while doing PVP too.

How to install it?

    Download the attached File.
    Extract its content.
    Put Feral.cs in Honorbuddy\Custom Classes\Singular  		\Classspecific\Druid (overwrite the existing file)
    Put Common.cs in Honorbuddy\Custom Classes\Singular	\Classspecific\Druid (overwrite the existing file)
    Put DruidSettings.cs in Honorbuddy\Custom Classes\Singular	\Settings (overwrite the existing file)
